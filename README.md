# Airline Price Prediction 


## Introduction
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted. Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities. 





### Motivation
As we all know, data is unstructured in order to be more flexible to a wide range of formats. In most cases, organized framework input options (such as checkboxes, drop-down menu selections, and radio buttons) fall short of appropriately framing and appropriating data, resulting in unstructured data that can be altered to work with them retroactively. To that aim, data of various types can only be recorded in unstructured formats. Consider how difficult it would be to compile important but disparate data about a patient's preferences, clinical particulate, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, and a plethora of other patient-specific informational components into a unified and intuitive data format that could then be analyzed by various algorithms to help determine the best course of patient care.


### Data
Size of training set: 10683 records
FEATURES: Airline: The name of the airline.
Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey
Source: The source from which the service begins.
Destination: The destination where the service ends.
Route: The route taken by the flight to reach the destination.
Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source.
Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.
Duration: Total duration of the flight.
Total_Stops: Total stops between the source and destination.
Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight
Price: The price of the ticket


### Business Understanding
Current research within this domain imply that airline ticket prices can be predicted using a set of a certain features which can be useful companies and tourist to deduce the price and when is the best time to buy a flight ticket. As the price of a flight ticket fluctuates as there is a seasonal price is applied from time to time, it is difficult to get an accurate prediction. Thus, the main question now is it possible to predict the ticket price based on features related to the flight itself such as flight duration, number of stops, etc.



### Medthodology
Initially, I plan to delve deep into the data to gain a complete understanding of the many variables. I intend to do some data wrangling and cleaning to cope with missing values and other issues. Once the data has been cleansed, I plan to perform exploratory analysis to extract any intriguing insights from it. Feature engineering will also be used to uncover new significant features that may be employed in the model construction process. Finally, various models will be created using machine learning methods. Data visualizations will support in the communication of these findings and will help to tell a story.
